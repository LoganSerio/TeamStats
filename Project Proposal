# Summary:
Team Stats is a solution for club sports teams, no matter their sport’s obscurity, to collect statistics on their players and team 
by providing them a mobile application to input and view important data for their respective sport. Our target clients are collegiate 
club sports teams who participate in any club sport who do not already have an easy method to collect statistics. Other possible clients
include high school teams, intramural teams, and any other athletic group who participates in semi-competitive leagues.
Club sports teams are experiencing large growth in colleges across the United States that do not have NCAA approved teams, but have 
students who desire to participate in their sport with others. We plan on reaching out to teams of more non-traditional sports that do 
not have the proper tools to effectively store statistics. While there are apps the specialize in collecting sports statistics, there is 
no app all in one app that provides teams of all sports a platform to store their data. Our application will address these pain 
points that will allow teams a place to store all of their data, no matter their sport. If we do not have a template already prepared 
for your team, we will give your team the option of creating your own template for your team’s specific needs. No other app that we have
found provides this to its customers. We will be developing our application for the Google Play Store using Android Development Studio 
and if time allows, also the Apple App store.

# Value Proposition: 
Our vision is to create an all in one app that caters to all of team’s statistical needs. It doesn’t matter if they play a club sport, 
collegiate sport, high school sport, or even participate in a recreational league, we would like to supply them with the tools to 
collect and record their stats, no matter the sport. We want our app to be full of customization options which allows for teams to keep
the positional statistics for the sports they care about. Customers want to decide the statistics they collect, and we want to provide 
them with a solution that is easy to use.

# Customer Pain Point:
We want to be the first in a market that does not yet completely exist. Consumer’s want customization, control, and simplicity in their 
collection of statistics broken down by category for their team, and no app on the market yet does these things. This positional system 
gives a greater number of options to the users since THEY get to choose what THEY care about. We will provide solutions that allow our
customers to collect exactly what data they want to collect and will provide a simplistic solution that makes entering and viewing their
data pain free, while keeping their cost low. 

# Customer Segments:
# Primary Market: 
# Club Sports (Collegiate) and High School Teams
Our main concentration would be on very organized teams that have a want or already do record their team’s and player’s statistics such 
as collegiate club sports and high school sports teams. These teams would support our product because right now there is no quality 
solution to collecting customized data, and we will provide them that. 
The United States would be our primary location since the participation in club and high school sports is so high. 
# Market size: 
According to the New York Times, an estimated two million college students play competitive club sports compared to the 430,000 involved
in sports affiliated with the NCAA and the NAIA. Along with the large number of students involved in club sports, high school sports, 
recreational leagues, and intramurals continually tends to have a large amount of participation across the United States. This shows 
that the market is large even if not every team records statistics.
# Secondary market: 
Intramural Sports and Recreational Leagues 
Our secondary market would be those teams that could at some point want to keep track of their statistics such as intramural sports and
recreational leagues. These tend to be, but not always, less organized and focused on having fun. Many teams, will still find use for 
our product as they work towards understanding their team dynamic better through data.
# Channels: 
Our main channel of delivering the application will be the Google Play Store. The Android OS dominates the smartphone market share, so 
we believe it is important to start where the most people are. Furthermore, Google provides many resources for new developers, and it 
is significantly cheaper to put an app on the Google Play Store.After doing some research on the Google Play store, Apple App store, 
and online, we found that there is no app focused on club sports, only more mainstream sports such as football, basketball, baseball,
and soccer. With our app, we want players of any sport to be able to record and track their team’s statistics.
# Customer Relationships: 
By being the first to build an app like ours, we have the benefit of being able to establish brand loyalty early on. We will get customers
from marketing, word-of-mouth, and collaboration will various sports teams across the nation. Our product will speak for itself, and we 
know that once we get it in customer’s hands, they will keep coming back. Our team will be focused early on reading customer feedback
and pushing updates through the Google Play Store to address any issues that customers face. Through our surveys, we found that our 
target audience is interested in communicating with us via email and social media, so we will have dedicated accounts for customer 
support and feedback on all platforms. The most direct way to offer concerns, criticism, or suggestions is through 
teamstatsfeedback@gmail.com. The developers are sure to quickly to respond to your feedback since we know that it is our customers that
make the app great.
# Revenue Streams:
Our survey indicates that customers are most interested in a free app with in app advertisements, so that will initially be our primary 
method of collecting money. If our customer base and brand loyalty grow as high as we expect, we will consider implementing premium 
features for a monthly subscription in the future. 
# Key Resources:
Our key resources lie within our team. Many of us have participated in some form of organized sports, and we have experienced the problem
we are trying to address. Having experienced these products, we have insights on what our customers will want. Furthermore, we all have
the drive, passion, and intellect necessary to build a successful product.  Key development resources for this project are Android Studio
and GitHub.
# Key Partners:
We have already collaborated the LSU Ultimate Frisbee Club, LSU Soccer Club, and LSU Tennis Club, and they have all been enthusiastic 
and interested in the project. They will be critical contacts when we need ideas or suggestions on how they would like to see certain 
features implemented. Furthermore Dr. Supratik Mukhopadhyay will be a valuable resource in helping us understand the software
development process and will aid us in our implementation. 
# Key Activities:
The most important part in ensuring a successful outcome is to make sure we stay focused, dedicated, and ahead of the development process.
Once our product launches, we must have a focus on our customers and their feedback. It is necessary that we respond to problems quickly
to ensure users have a positive experience and want to continue using our app. 
# Cost Structure:
Launching an app on the Google Play Store has a one-time fee of $25. Our only other expected expense is the time invested in creating
the application. As mentioned in the “Revenue Streams” section, we plan on having in app advertisements and eventually moving to a model
with a free version and a premium version where customers pay a monthly fee for extra features. 
# How we will accomplish this:
•	Marketing and distribution strategy: Marketing and distribution will be crucial in developing successful software, as functional
software with no users is not useful. Our marketing strategy will develop in phases. First, we will focus on college campuses, reaching 
out to club sports teams across the country to let them know what our app provides and allowing them to use the software for free. Then,
we will broaden our advertising through online platforms like Google Adsense to target young adults who participate in sports and 
recreational leagues. From there, we expect our app to roll out through word of mouth and continued advertisement. 
•	Developing strategy: Our application will be developed in phases using Android Development Studio. We have found that the Android 
Platform is a good place for young developers such as ourselves. A future goal, beyond this class, is to develop the app for IOS 
compatibility, but due to the time constraint, we expect that phase to be after May 2017. 
•	Management: All four team members will serve an equal role in the development of our app, and all members will have equal say and 
contribution in the process. 
# Barriers:
We will be facing a few barriers with this application:
•	Finishing on time
•	Lack of app development experience 
•	Rudimentary large scale programming knowledge 
•	No pre-existing customer base. 

# Critical risks:
Conglomerates: ESPN, Yahoo, companies with large customer bases focused on sports could potentially see our app, take our idea, and use 
their enormous amounts of resources to build a similar app and market it to their pre-existing customer base.
# Competition:        
There are not many applications in this market as of now. There are various apps that focus on one sport exclusively. With our app, 
players would be able to keep any stats they wanted on any sport they played. The idea is to have plenty of customization options to 
where teams could record and track the statistics they saw fit. We don’t want to force our users to keep stats they don’t find useful
for their team.

•	There are a few apps on both stores that record stats but they have various problems
* Only focus on one sport, not a wide variety of sports, haven’t been updated in a while (years), must be bought, poor user interface, etc. 

# Competitive Advantages:
One of our biggest competitive advantages is that we plan on offering more customization options than any of the other applications in
our market. We will be offering a large amount of customization to allow our users to track and record any statistics they want, not 
what we tell them too. Another advantage is that we are open to receiving feedback from our users to continuously improve our 
application’s ability to suit their needs. A competitive analysis has shown that our competition has been inactive in updating their
app for an extended period of time and as such lets us to set ourselves apart by responding to the user base. Lastly, our low 
development costs permits us to launch the app for free and as such make it as easy as possible for potential customers to give the app 
a try without having a cost barrier.
