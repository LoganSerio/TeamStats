3 User Interface Components
3.1 Home Menu
The Team Stats homepage is the first screen the user will see after opening the application. This homepage has three main options on it: “Create A Team”, “Existing Teams”, and “Settings”. Clicking “Create New Team” will direct the user to a new screen with a list of pre-built templates for various sports and the option to a create a new template for their sport or team. If the user wants to see the statistic pages for the teams they have already created, then “Existing Teams” should be clicked. The “Settings” option will allow the user to send the developers feedback and reorder their teams.
The homepage also has a quick menu, denoted by “≡”, that allows for faster traveling around the app, but we recommend using the quick menu when you are on any screen except the homepage, since they both serve a similar purpose (see 3.2 Quick Menu for more information).
3.2 Quick Menu
The quick menu, denoted by “≡”, is the fastest way for the user to get around Team Stats without having to return all the way to the app’s homepage. The quick menu allows the user to rapidly switch from whatever screen they are on to one of these options: “Create A Team”, and “Settings” while also displaying all their existing teams (if applicable). When the user clicks on “Create A Team” or “Settings” the quick menu will close and the user will be brought to the templates page or the settings page respectively. If a user has existing teams and clicks on one of them, they will be brought to that team’s statistics page, also closing the quick menu.
3.3 Settings Page
3.3.1 Send Feedback
If the user presses the “Send Feedback” button, A new screen appears with a blank textbox for the message, another blank textbox for the user’s email address, and a button that says “Submit.” The user can write their feedback and email address in the text boxes and press the send button once finished. Our team will try to reach out to the user as soon as we can.
3.3.2 Reorder Teams
If the user presses the “Reorder Teams” button, A new screen appears allowing the user to drag and drop the teams the user has created into whatever order they would like. At the top of the list of teams, there is a sort button that, when pressed, will display a drop-down menu. The drop-down menu has a list of ways the user can arrange the teams if the user does not want to rearrange the teams using the dropdown process.
3.4 Team Creation Page
The team creation page can be accessed by clicking “Create A Team” on either the homepage or the quick menu. When “Create A Team” is selected, the user will be brought to the Templates Page, where they will find pre-built statistical pages for a few sports. If they do not find those fit for their needs, they will be able to create a new template by selecting “Create New” at the bottom of the Templates Page. No matter if the user decides to select a pre-built template or create their own, they will have full customization over the categories they would like to track and how they are calculated.
3.4.1 Templates Page
The Templates Page is found after clicking on “Create A Team” from the homepage or the quick menu. This page has pre-built templates for football, basketball, baseball, and soccer. These pre-built templates have the most common kept statistical categories for each respective sport. They are mostly ready to go, all they need is for the user to input player names. And of course, they are 100 percent customizable so if the user wants to add or remove categories or even tinker with how the category is calculated, they can do so with ease.
If the user doesn’t want to use one of the pre-built templates the app has to offer, then they can create their own by selecting the “Create New” option at the bottom of the templates page. By selecting “Create New”, the user has total control over every aspect of their statistics page. They can add as many categories they want to track, how those categories are calculated, how many players are on the team, and more, it’s all up to the user.

3.4.2 Edit Categories
Editing categories is a very simple task when setting up a team page. To add a category to the team page, just click the “+” by the last category already made. Once “+” is selected, a text box will appear allowing you to name the category. Once that’s done, if the user wishes to edit how that category is calculated, all they would need to do is double tap the name of that category.
If the user wishes to add a player to the team page, all they would have to do is click the “+” under the last player on the team page. A text box will appear and allow the user to enter that player’s name.
To delete a category or player, just click the “-” by the player or category you wish to delete.
Once the user is finished editing categories and players, hitting “Done” will save all their progress and display their team page.


3.5 Existing Teams Page
The existing teams page provides a list of teams that were previously created by the user. If the user hasn’t created a team yet, the user will be directed to a different page saying “You have no existing teams. Would you like to create a team or return to the main menu?”  with buttons labeled “Create a Team” and “Return to Main Menu” underneath. If the user has existing teams, the user now has the option to select a team and go to that specific team’s team page.

3.6 Specific Team Page
From the Specific Team Page, the user can see the stats and roster of the team. The user also has the option to select one of three buttons: Share, Edit, and Delete.
3.6.1 Team Overview Tab

3.6.2 Team Options Tab

3.6.2a Edit Players Button

3.6.2b Edit Position

3.6.2c Edit Statistics Button

3.6.2d Delete Button
If the user presses the “Delete” button, a window will pop up saying “You are about to delete this team. Deleting a team will erase all information about this team forever. Are you sure you want to continue?” Below the message the user is given the options “Yes” or “No.” If the user selects “Yes” the specified team will be deleted. If the User selects “No” the pop up window will disappear and the user will remain on the Specific Team Page.
   *Disclaimer: Deleting a team is permanent and information about the deleted team cannot be recovered*
